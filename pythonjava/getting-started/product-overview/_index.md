## Overview

**Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java** is a powerful and reliable library for barcode generation and recognition.  
It features a robust barcode engine implemented in Java, while providing a native Python API for 
seamless integration into Python applications.

The library uses the Python-Java bridge to enable communication between the Python interface 
and the underlying Java engine,  
allowing developers to access advanced barcode functionality with simple and familiar 
Python syntax.


## Product Description

**Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java** is a versatile library designed to streamline barcode processing tasks in
PHP applications via Java. It offers robust capabilities for generating and recognizing both 1D (one-dimensional)
and 2D (two-dimensional) barcode types at any angleâ€”quickly and efficiently.

This library supports over **80 barcode symbologies**, fully compatible with most industry standards and specifications.

A comprehensive list of supported barcode types is available in <a href="/barcode/python-java/barcode-types/" target="_blank">Supported Barcode Types</a>.

The most important features are the following:
- **Barcode generation and recognition** for 80+ barcode types
- **Reading barcodes** at any angle and from images of various quality levels
- **Customizing barcode appearance**, including size, height, resolution, colors, rotation angle, text labels, captions,
  X-dimension, wide-to-narrow ratio, and more
- **Optimizing recognition engine settings** to balance accuracy and speed
- **Selecting a specific scanning region** for targeted barcode detection
- **Generating barcodes with special modes**, such as ECI, error correction, and embedded metadata
- **Rotating images** at any angle
- **Saving and loading barcodes** from files or data streams
- **Encoding and decoding non-ASCII characters** in 2D barcode formats
  See <a href="/barcode/phpjava/features/" target="_blank">The List of Product Features</a> for more details.
