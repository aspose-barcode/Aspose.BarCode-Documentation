## Overview

**Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java** is a powerful and reliable library for barcode generation and recognition.  
It features a robust barcode engine implemented in Java, while providing a native Python API for 
seamless integration into Python applications.

The library uses the Python-Java bridge to enable communication between the Python interface 
and the underlying Java engine,  
allowing developers to access advanced barcode functionality with simple and familiar 
Python syntax.


## Product Description

**Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java** is a versatile library designed to streamline barcode processing in Python applications.  
It leverages a high-performance Java-based engine while exposing a clean and intuitive Python API.

The library provides powerful features for generating and recognizing both 1D (linear) and 2D (matrix) barcodes —  
efficiently and at any rotation angle. It supports over **80 barcode symbologies**, fully aligned with industry standards and specifications.

A complete list of supported barcode types is available on the  
<a href="/barcode/python-java/barcode-types/" target="_blank">Supported Barcode Types</a> page.

## Key Features

- **Generate and recognize** more than 80 barcode types
- **Read barcodes** at any angle and from low-quality or distorted images
- **Customize barcode appearance**, including dimensions, resolution, colors, rotation, labels, captions,  
  X-dimension, and wide-to-narrow ratios
- **Optimize recognition settings** to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy
- **Define scanning regions** to detect barcodes in specific image areas
- **Use advanced encoding modes**, such as ECI, structured append, and error correction
- **Rotate images** and barcodes to any angle programmatically
- **Save and load barcodes** from file systems or memory streams
- **Encode and decode Unicode and non-ASCII characters** in 2D barcode formats

For a full list of capabilities, see the <a href="/barcode/python-java/product-features/" target="_blank">Product Features</a> page.

## System Compatibility

**Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java** is a platform-independent API designed to run 
seamlessly across major operating systems.  
It can be used on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, provided that both **Python** 
and **Java** are installed and properly configured.
This allows developers to integrate the library into a broad range of systems, 
regardless of the underlying platform.
