## Features of Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java

Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java provides a wide range of features for barcode generation, recognition, and image processing.  
It offers fine-grained control over appearance, encoding, decoding, and output formats ‚Äî all powered by a robust Java engine  
and accessed through a native Python API.

### üßæ Barcode Generation

- Generate barcodes in over **80 symbologies**, including standard **1D** and **2D** types, as well as postal formats such as  
  **Royal Mail Mailmark**, **Australia Post**, **Swiss Post**, and others
- Fully customize **barcode appearance**: size, rotation angle, resolution, colors, text captions, margins,  
  **bar height**, **X-dimension**, and more
- Support for advanced encoding options, including **error correction** (ECC), **extended channel interpretation (ECI)**,  
  and **checksum controls**
- Export barcodes to popular **raster and vector formats**: **JPEG**, **PNG**, **BMP**, **GIF**, **TIFF**, **EMF**, **SVG**
- Generate **composite and structured barcodes**, including optional **supplementary data segments**

### üîç Barcode Recognition

- Recognize barcodes from both **raster and vector images**
- Detect barcodes at **any rotation angle**, including **damaged**, **noisy**, or low-resolution images
- Specify **target symbologies** and **scan regions** for optimized recognition performance
- Utilize **multithreaded recognition** to increase processing speed in high-load environments
- Validate **checksums** for **1D**, **2D**, and **postal barcode formats**
- Fine-tune the recognition engine with **manual settings** or select from **built-in accuracy/speed presets**

### üõ† Imaging and Output Options

- Configure **image borders**, **background and foreground colors**, **margins**, **quality**, and **DPI resolution**
- Support for **anti-aliasing**, **automatic sizing**, and **barcode rotation** at any angle
- Full **Unicode support** for encoding and decoding multilingual data and special characters
- Load and save barcodes using **file paths**, **byte streams**, or **memory buffers**
