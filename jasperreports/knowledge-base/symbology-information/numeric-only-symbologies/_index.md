#### **Standard 2 of 5**
This one-dimensional barcode is low density numeric symbology. It is used in the photofinishing and warehouse sorting industries. It is also used for numbering airline tickets sequentially. This symbology is called "2 of 5" due to the fact that digits are encoded with 5 bars, 2 of which are always wide (and the remaining three are narrow).

#### **ITF 14**
ITF 14 is a UPC shipping container symbology. It is used to mark cartons, cases or pallets. It contains UPC or EAN product identification numbers, and it consists of 14 numbers in total.

#### **PostNet**
[PostNet](http://www.aspose.com/Wiki/wikiedit.aspx?topic=Aspose.BarCode.PostNet&return=Aspose.BarCode.SymbologyBackground) is also one dimensional symbology that was developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to allow faster sorting and routing of mail. The barcode itself can encode standard 5-digit Zip codes, Zip+4 codes or full 11-point delivery point codes.

#### **USPS OneCode**

#### **EAN128**
This one-dimensional symbology is also called UCC/EAN128. It is derived from Code128 symbology. It is used to provide a worldwide format and standard for exchanging common data between companies. While other barcodes simply encode data with no respect for what the data represents, UCC/EAN-128 encodes data and what that data represents. This is done by using application identifiers (AI). For example, AI=11 denotes production date. The following label shows that production date is Jan 2nd, 2007:
