A barcode symbology is a system of encoding data so that a scanner and/or a decoding system may together read and decode the data. Apart from the actual technique of encoding bars and spaces, a number of technical specifications or characteristics define and separate different symbologies. Different barcode symbologies may have different features and characteristics.

Sometimes, barcode symbologies are also referred to as a *language* in the sense that it allows humans to interact with computers just like other programming languages do. The bars and spaces in a barcode are the elements of the language that can be understood by a computer. In the industry, people use barcode readers or scanners to read information from a barcode, and different actions are performed on the basis of that information. Not all barcode readers support all barcode symbologies, with the exception of Code128 which is supported by most readers.

Aspose.BarCode for Jasper Reports provides world-class barcode generation and recognition of most popular one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) barcode symbologies. In other knowledge base topics, we have listed and described all those supported barcode symbologies. These symbologies are classified into following categories:

- [Numeric Only Symbologies](/barcode/jasperreports/numeric-only-symbologies-html/)
- [Partially Alphanumeric Symbologies](/barcode/jasperreports/partially-alphanumeric-symbologies-html/)
- [Fully Alphanumeric Symbologies](/barcode/jasperreports/fully-alphanumeric-symbologies-html/)
