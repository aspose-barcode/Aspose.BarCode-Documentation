You can easily download an evaluation version of Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/default.aspx). The evaluation version provides the same capabilities as the licensed version of the component. Furthermore, the evaluation version is licensed by simply buying a license and after [applying a license](http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/barcodejasperreports/Applying+a+License).

The evaluation version of Aspose.BarCode (that is, the application without a license applied) provides full barcode generation functionality but puts an evaluation watermark (the words Aspose.Demo) on the barcode image.

If you want to try Aspose.BarCode without evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/temporary-license.aspx) for more information.
