***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** is a robust and reliable barcode generation and recognition component written in Java that
allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to Java applications. It
provides a group of classes to work with barcodes on the backend, as well as GUI-based controls.
_**Aspose.BarCode for Java**_ offers a versatile and powerful solution for managing barcodes. One key advantage is the
ability to adjust barcode recognition engine variables, allowing you to balance reading quality and speed. One of its
standout features is the ability to configure barcode recognition engine variables, allowing you to strike the perfect
balance between reading quality and speed. This flexibility even enables the recognition of severely corrupted barcodes,
ensuring reliability in challenging scenarios. The library also provides extensive customisation options for barcode
appearance and parameters. You can adjust settings such as background colour, bar colour, rotation angle, X-dimension,
image quality, resolution, captions, size, and more, tailoring the output to fit your specific requirements.
***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** enables compatibility with most of the existing barcode standards and specifications. It
not only enables barcode generation but also provides an extensive framework to control the key aspects of barcode
processing.

## **Product Description**

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** is a powerful and versatile library designed to streamline barcode processing tasks
in Java applications. Implemented with managed code, it offers seamless functionality for generating and recognizing
a wide variety of barcode types, both linear and matrix, at any angle—quickly and effortlessly.

This library is fully compatible with most existing barcode specifications and standards, supporting over 80
symbologies.

The detailed listing of all available barcode types is provided
in <a href="/barcode/java/barcode-types/" target="_blank">Supported Barcode Types</a>.

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** has many characteristics that make it a flexible and easy-to-use tool.
It is a fully functional library that provides both generation and reading functionality.
Generated barcodes can be saved in five high-quality raster image formats and two vector ones.
The other advantage is that the library facilitates decoding even low-quality or damaged barcode images.
Therefore, it enables high recognition efficiency for most supported symbology types.

## **Licensing**

License is required to get access to the advanced functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for Java***.  
The evaluation mode of ***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** allows generating barcode images without restrictions. However, a
watermark will be displayed on the resulting barcode image (words “Aspose”). The unlicensed version can be used to read
barcodes of all supported types. Please note that only *Code 39* can be decoded without limitations; as a result of
reading barcodes corresponding to other types, 30% of decoded text will be masked with " * ". All other actions with
barcodes using ***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** need setting a license. After purchasing a license, you will get access to
the whole functionality of the library and the ability to perform barcode generation and reading without limitations and
watermark placement.

More information about how to buy and set the license is provided
in <a href="/barcode/java/licensing/" target="_blank"><strong>Licensing</strong></a>.  
If you want to evaluate the full functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for Java***, you can obtain a temporary license that
is valid for 30 days.  
Please refer to <a href="https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license" target="_blank">How to get a Temporary
License</a> for details.

## **Main Classes**

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** contains two main classes: [
*BarCodeReader*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/BarCodeReader) for
barcode scanning and reading, [
*BarcodeGenerator*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.generation/BarcodeGenerator) for
