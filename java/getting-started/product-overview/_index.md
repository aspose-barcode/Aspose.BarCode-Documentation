***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** is a robust and reliable barcode generation and recognition component written in Java that allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to Java applications. It provides a group of classes to work with barcodes on the backend, as well as GUI-based controls.
_**Aspose.BarCode for Java**_ offers a versatile and powerful solution for managing barcodes. One key advantage is the ability to adjust barcode recognition engine variables, allowing you to balance reading quality and speed. One of its standout features is the ability to configure barcode recognition engine variables, allowing you to strike the perfect balance between reading quality and speed. This flexibility even enables the recognition of severely corrupted barcodes, ensuring reliability in challenging scenarios. The library also provides extensive customization options for barcode appearance and parameters. You can adjust settings such as background colour, bar colour, rotation angle, X-dimension, image quality, resolution, captions, size, and more, tailoring the output to fit your specific requirements.
***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** enables compatibility with most of the existing barcode standards and specifications. It not only enables barcode generation but also provides an extensive framework to control the key aspects of barcode processing.

This article describes its main features, including information about its functionality, input and output image formats, important classes, and supported platforms.

## **Product Description**

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** is a powerful and versatile library designed to streamline barcode processing tasks in Java applications. Implemented with managed code, it offers seamless functionality for generating and recognizing a wide variety of barcode types, both linear and matrix, at any angleâ€”quickly and effortlessly.

This library is fully compatible with most existing barcode specifications and standards, supporting over 80 symbologies, including:

1D barcodes
2D barcodes (such as QR codes)
Postal barcodes
For a comprehensive list of supported barcode types, please refer to Supported Barcode Types.

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** has many characteristics that make it a flexible and easy-to-use tool. It is a fully functional library that provides both generation and reading functionality. Generated barcodes can be saved in five high-quality raster image formats and two vector ones. The other advantage is that the library facilitates decoding even low-quality or damaged barcode images. Therefore, it enables high recognition efficiency for most of the supported symbologies. There are no printing limitations for barcodes generated through the Aspose.BarCode library. Developers can utilize any type of printers. The quality of printed barcode images will depend only on the resolution of a printer.

Developers can download fully featured demos and working examples written in Java to provide developers with a better understanding of our product. Using these demos, developers can quickly test functionality provided by Aspose.BarCode.

### **Main Features**

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** benefits from a great variety of features that can serve to address various business needs. One of the most important functions is the customisation of barcode appearance-related properties, including barcode size, the color of barcode elements, rotation angle, image quality, X-dimension, resolution, text captions, and many others. Moreover, rich barcode reading and imaging functionality is available.

The most important features are the following:

- Barcode generation and recognition for over 60 barcode types
- Reading barcodes at any angle and from images of any quality
- Customization of barcode appearance (size, height, resolution, color, rotation angle, text label and captions, X-dimension, wide-to-narrow-ratio, and others)
- Optimization of recognition engine variables to achieve the desired trade-off between reading accuracy and speed
- Target scanning region selection
- Barcode generation using special modes, such as ECI, error correction, or embedded metadata
- Image rotation at any angle
- Saving to or loading from stream or file
- Encoding and decoding non-English characters in 2D types

The list of all features can be found in [**Product Features**](https://docs.aspose.com/barcode/java/product-features/).

## **System Compatibility**

Aspose.BarCode for Java supports any operating system where Java JDK/JRE can be installed.

***Aspose.BarCode for Node.js*** via Java is a platform-independent API that is compatible with any platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS etc.) where Node.js and Node-Java bridge are installed. The machine must have Oracle JDK 7 or greater versions installed before setting up the library.
***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** is a platform-independent API that can be run on any platform (Windows, Linux, etc.) where PHP and Java Bridge are installed.

## **Supported Platforms**

- Java Standard Edition version 1.8 or later

## **Licensing**

License is required to get access to the advanced functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for Java***. The evaluation mode allows generating barcodes without any restrictions. However, watermarks are displayed on generated barcode images. Barcode recognition functionality is provided without limitations only for Code 39 barcodes. For all other barcode types, 30% of the decoded text will be masked. More information about how to buy and set the license is provided in [**Licensing**](/barcode/java/licensing/). If you want to evaluate the full functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for Java***, you can obtain a temporary license that is valid for 30 days. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) for details.

## **Main Classes**

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** contains two main classes: [*BarCodeReader*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/BarCodeReader) for barcode scanning and reading, [*BarcodeGenerator*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.generation/BarcodeGenerator) for barcode generation according to the specified format requirements. Namespace [*ComplexBarcode*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.complexbarcode/package-frame) is developed separately to manage sophisticated barcode types, i.e. Swiss QR Code, MaxiCode, and HIBC LIC.
