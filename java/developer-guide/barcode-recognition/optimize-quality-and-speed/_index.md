This documentation part provides a detailed description of various recognition quality settings that can be customized to optimize the accuracy and speed of barcode reading in ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET***.

Barcode reading relies on machine vision mechanisms and uses various mathematical algorithms for object detection. Same as in other computer vision tasks, source image quality is crucial to convert an arbitrary image to machine-readable code. Low-quality barcode images may result being unreadable depending on specific recognition standards. There are different approaches to read barcodes of unacceptable quality. However, running such methods takes extra CPU computation time and may lead to the considerable increase in recognition time.

***Aspose.BarCode for Java*** suggests optimizing the recognition process in terms of quality and speed in line with specific business needs. A special class called [*QualitySettings*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/QualitySettings) provides flexible recognition settings to achieve the acceptable trade-off between reading acuracy and speed depending the quality of a source barcode image.
