# Barcode Recognition

This section explains how to recognize barcodes with Aspose.BarCode for Java using `BarCodeReader`.
You will learn how to choose input sources, configure recognition, tune performance and quality, and read result properties.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a `BarCodeReader` from a file, stream, or in-memory image.
2. Restrict recognition to expected symbologies when possible.
3. Use ROI when the barcode location is known.
4. Choose quality settings based on your input and latency requirements.
5. Read results and validate them before using the data.

## Start here

- If you already have an image: go to [Input Sources: Files, Streams, and Bitmaps](input-sources).
- If you need a baseline configuration: go to [Basic Recognition Setup](basic-recognition-setup).
- If recognition is slow or unstable: go to [Performance & Quality](performance).
- If you need geometry, metadata, or validation: go to [Reading Barcode Properties](barcode-properties).
