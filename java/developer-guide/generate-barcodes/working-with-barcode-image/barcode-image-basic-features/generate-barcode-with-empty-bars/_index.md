[Aspose.BarCode](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/java) APIs allows controlling the filling of bars of a barcode. The [Aspose.BarCode](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/java) for Java API has exposed the FilledBars for the [BarcodeGenerator](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/java/com.aspose.barcode.generation/BarcodeGenerator) to generate filled or empty bars.

This property works only with 1D barcodes.

The BarcodeGenerator provides setFilledBars() method and the default value is set to true; that means if this property is not set then the generated barcodes will have filled bars by default.

The following is an example of the new API usage:
