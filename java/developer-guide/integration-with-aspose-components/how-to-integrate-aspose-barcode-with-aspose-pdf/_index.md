PDF documents have become a popular medium for generating reports or other official documents in many organizations. Aspose Pty Ltd. provides a component, Aspose.PDF to generate PDF documents. Developers can add barcodes to their PDF documents by integrating Aspose.BarCode with Aspose.PDF. 
  
Aspose.BarCode can easily be integrated with any of the Aspose Components to create rich applications for fulfilling the maximum requirements of the users. The most interesting thing is that any change in Aspose.BarCode version would not affect its integration with other Aspose Components because Aspose.PDF only deals with the barcode image produced by the Aspose.BarCode and not its internal structure.
