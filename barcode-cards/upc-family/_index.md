Universal Product Code (UPC) was initially developed in the 1970s for use by the US grocery industry, and its use has spread into other retail marketplaces in the US and internationally. UPC-A is a subset of the European Article Numbering (EAN) system, which means that any system that can read EAN can also read UPC-A. A UPC-A symbol that is created in the United States can be transformed into an EAN-13 symbol by prefixing it with a zero.
  
UPC-A is defined in ISO/IEC 15420 Information technology - Automatic identification and data capture techniques - EAN/UPC bar code symbology specification. The GS1 implementation is defined in GS1 General Specifications.

The UPC family includes the following subtypes: 
- [UPC-A](/barcode/info-cards/upc-a/)
- [UPC-E](/barcode/info-cards/upc-e/)
  
GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) is a system developed by the GS1 and is an internationally recognized system for identifying products. It is a blanket term to describe various GS1 numbering codes â€“ UPC and EAN. It is, hence, safe to term an EAN-13 code as a GTIN-13. GTIN provides the global supply chain solution for the identification of any item that is traded (priced, ordered, and invoiced).
