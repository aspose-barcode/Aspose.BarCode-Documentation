{{% alert color="primary" %}}[Read](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/recognize/code39) and [Generate](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/generate/code39) Code 39 barcodes online. You can test the quality of ***Aspose.BarCode*** functionality and view results.{{% /alert %}}

## **Overview**
The UPC-A barcode is the most common type in the United States, and the most widely recognized.

## **Usage Scenarios**
It is used mostly in retail settings, such as grocery stores. UPC-A was developed by the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council, in conjunction with IBM, and has been in use since 1974.  
The UPC barcode is used only in the US and Canada, while the EAN is used everywhere else. This owes to a previous assumption that products made in the USA and Canada would only be sold within these borders. However, with the rise of globalisation, the UPC and EAN have become somewhat interchangeable.
  
## **Characteristics**
### **Encoding Character Set**
This symbology supports all numeric digits (0-9).

### **Barcode Structure**
The symbol comprises the following elements:

- Leading quiet zone
- Guard pattern (start character)
- Six symbol characters
- Center guard pattern (center character)
- Six symbol characters, including check digit
- Guard pattern (stop character)
- Trailing quiet zone

### **Size Dimensions**

### **Encoding Capacity and Data Density**
A UPC-A barcode consists of 12 digits. It begins with a single digit number system character, which designates how the code should be classified: as a regular product, a weighted item, pharmaceuticals, coupons, etc. After that is a five digit manufacturer's number, followed by a five digit product number, and finally a check digit. Each digit is represented by a uniquely identifiable pattern of two bars and two spaces of varying width. No letters or other special characters aside from numbers may be used.  
  
With four available printing widths for the bars and spaces instead of just two, UPC-A takes about half the number of bars and spaces relative to Interleaved 2 of 5 to represent each character. However, the use of the wider bars and spaces nullifies this space savings. Interleaved 2 of 5 codes pack data more densely than UPC-A does.

### **Checksum Controls**
UPC-A contains a check digit that is based on the modulo 10 (mod 10) algorithm.

## **Advantages and Limitations**
UPC-A barcodes are simple, short, popular, and can be read by just about any standard barcode reader. In addition, the check digit guards against accidental errors, especially when entering in the code by hand. A mathematical formula computes the first 11 digits together in a certain way to get the final digit. So if the check digit does not match the digit generated by the other numbers, you know immediately that there is an error.
The 12 digit system of a UPC-A barcode provides for small, limited encoding, which makes it ideal for supermarket and retail use, but less suited for other scanning and identification purposes.
Most barcode symbologies print bars and spaces in only two widths, but with UPC, four different widths are used. This enables each numeric character to be represented by using just two bars and two spaces, which is the fewest number of modules required per character of any symbology.
