**Definition**

The X-dimension is one of the most important characteristics of all barcode types that is defined as the width of the narrowest bar in a barcode. It serves to estimate the other key parameter of any symbology, density. Density is the amount of data encoded in a barcode per unit of space. Various elements of a barcode and its size dimensions are often determined relative to the value of the X-dimension. For example, to enable successful scanning, some symbologies require setting a quiet zone with the width of at least 10X where X is the X-dimension value. The greater is the X-dimension, the quicker and more accurate is the barcode reading and decoding procedure.
