European Article Number (EAN) is a standardized barcode system implemented primarily in Europe and other parts of the world for identifying products for sale. The EAN barcode family enables several types of barcodes, including EAN-8, EAN-13, and EAN-14.  
  
[EAN-8](/barcode/info-cards/ean-8/) is a shortened version of the EAN-13 barcode and is useful for smaller items such as candy or pencils. It contains 8 digits and is typically used in addition to an EAN-13 barcode on the same product. The first two digits of an EAN-8 barcode represent the country code, the next three digits represent the manufacturer code, and the last three digits represent the product code.  
  
[EAN-13](/barcode/info-cards/ean-13/) is the most common type of EAN barcode that consists of 13 digits. It serves to identify various products sold in retail and is typically placed on the product packaging. The first two or three digits of an EAN-13 barcode represent the country code, the next four digits represent the manufacturer code, and the last five or six digits represent the product code.  
  
EAN-14 is a variant of the EAN-13 barcode that serves to identify trade items in the retail supply chain. It is composed of 14 digits and includes a check digit, as well as a packaging indicator. The first two digits of an EAN-14 barcode represent the country code, the next three digits represent the manufacturer code, the next six digits represent the product code, and the last three digits include a check digit and a packaging indicator.  
  
All EAN barcodes use a specific pattern of bars and spaces to encode the product identification number, which is then scanned by barcode readers to quickly and accurately identify the product. The EAN barcode system is maintained by the International Article Numbering Association (EAN International) and is widely exploited by retailers, manufacturers, and other organizations worldwide to efficiently track and manage inventory and sales.
    
The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a system developed by GS1, an international organization that sets standards for the identification of products and services. GTIN is a general term that includes different numbering codes such as the Universal Product Code (UPC) and the European Article Number (EAN). An EAN-13 code, for example, can be referred to as a GTIN-13 code. GTIN can identify any product that is traded, whether it is being priced, ordered, or invoiced, and it is used to streamline the global supply chain.
