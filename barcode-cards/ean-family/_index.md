The EAN system combines barcode symbology and an accompanying number system, to assign each product with an entirely unique reference number. This number can be obtained by scanning the barcode graphic, using a barcode scanner.  
The EAN barcode is primarily used in supermarkets to identify product at the point of sales. The barcode and number combined are used in global trade to identify, “a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer”.  
Each country has a coding authority (or numbering association) which assigns codes to manufacturers and maintains a central database. 
  
GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) is a system developed by the GS1 and is an internationally recognized system for identifying products. It is a blanket term to describe various GS1 numbering codes – UPC and EAN. It is, hence, safe to term an EAN-13 code as a GTIN-13. GTIN provides the global supply chain solution for the identification of any item that is traded (priced, ordered, and invoiced).

The EAN barcode group includes the following subtypes: 
- [EAN 8](/barcode/info-cards/ean-8/)
- [EAN 13](/barcode/info-cards/ean-13/)
<!-- - [EAN 14](/barcode/info-cards/ean-14/)
 [EAN 2](/barcode/info-cards/ean-2/)
- [EAN 5](/barcode/info-cards/ean-5/)-->
