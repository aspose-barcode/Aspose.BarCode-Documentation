## **Overview**
ITF-14 is an application of Code 2/5 Interleaved that encodes a 14-digit GTIN (for Global Trade Item Number). ITF is short for Interleaved Two of Five, hence the name ITF-14. Shorter GTIN-13 (EAN 13 numbers) and GTIN-12 (UPC-A numbers) can be encoded by prepending the data with zeroes, see below. A so called bearer bar or frame can be put around the code. The frame has a defined thickness of 4.83mm (0.190"), independent of the selected module width and -height.

## **Usage Scenarios**
Itâ€™s mainly being used in trading but only on products that need no POS interaction. Since it can deal with high printing tolerances, it is a good choice when barcodes need to be printed on corrugated cardboard. IFT-14 barcodes are used to designate packaging levels of individual products such as boxes of 12 cans or boxes of 24 cans. As such they are not meant to be read at the point-of-sale or checkout but rather during transport, in receiving and in the warehouse. The first digit of the GTIN-14 describes the packaging level which can be any number between 1 and 8. The actual meaning of the packaging level is not standardized and depends on the context; staying with the boxes-of-cans example, level 1 may denote 12 cans per box while level 2 denotes 24 cans.

## **Characteristics**

### **Size Dimensions**
GS1 recommends the following settings for ITF-14:

Module width: 1.0mm (c. 0.04") or higher
Module height: 25mm (c. 1") or higher
Wide / narrow ratio: 2.25 - 3.00, typical 2.5
Quiet zone: min. 10x module width
Based on those recommendations, an ITF-14 barcode symbol with bearer frame is roughly 150mm (6") wide and 35mm (1.35") tall, making it far bigger than for example an EAN 13 barcode. Such a code can be reliably scanned with standard barcode laser scanners from a distance of up to 0.5-1m (max. 3ft.). Depending on the situation (e.g. when scanning the barcode from longer distances or on high-bay shelves) larger dimensions or, alternatively, long-range barcode scanners may be required.
