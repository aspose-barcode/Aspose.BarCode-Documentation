# Detailed Overview of Recognition Quality Settings

In **Aspose.BarCode for JavaScript via C++**, the recognition of barcodes is a sophisticated process leveraging machine vision and advanced mathematical algorithms for object detection and reading. The accuracy and speed of barcode recognition are heavily influenced by the quality of the input image. Images with low quality can sometimes be unreadable, which can challenge traditional barcode recognition techniques. Various strategies can be employed to read barcodes with lower image quality, but these techniques often demand significant CPU resources and increase processing time.

To cater to different business needs and image conditions, **Aspose.BarCode for JavaScript via C++** offers customization options through a class called **[QualitySettings](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/javascript-cpp/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/qualitysettings)**. This class allows you to fine-tune the recognition settings and achieve an optimal balance between reading speed and quality, ensuring that barcode reading is effective under various circumstances.
