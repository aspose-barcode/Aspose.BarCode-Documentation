## **Software Requirements**
### 1. Web Browser
- **Modern Web Browsers**: WebAssembly is supported in all major modern browsers. To run a WebAssembly application, you should ensure that you are using one of the following:
  - **Google Chrome** (Version 57+)
  - **Mozilla Firefox** (Version 52+)
  - **Safari** (Version 11+ for macOS and iOS)
  - **Microsoft Edge** (Version 16+)
  - **Opera** (Version 44+)
- **Browser Settings**: Ensure that WebAssembly is enabled in the browser. In most cases, it is enabled by default, but you can check the browser's settings or developer tools for confirmation.

### 2. Operating System
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: WebAssembly applications run in the browser, so they are generally independent of the underlying operating system. However, some performance and integration benefits can vary:
  - **Windows**: Works well with the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera.
  - **macOS**: Runs WebAssembly applications with Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
  - **Linux**: Compatible with major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
- **Mobile Devices**: Most modern mobile browsers support WebAssembly, so WebAssembly apps can run on smartphones and tablets with Android or iOS.

### 3. Web Server (Optional but Recommended)
- **Serving WebAssembly Files**: While you can open a `.html` file containing WebAssembly code directly in your browser, it's generally better to serve it via a web server to handle features like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and improved security.
- **Simple Local Servers**:
  - **Python HTTP Server**: `python3 -m http.server`
  - **Node.js http-server**: Install via `npm install -g http-server` and run with `http-server`.
- **Production Servers**: Use a web server like **Apache**, **Nginx**, or **nginx** for deploying WebAssembly apps to a public web environment.


## **Download Examples from GitHub**
All code examples available for ***Aspose.BarCode for JavaScript via C++*** are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET/tree/master/Examples). The project requires at least fully updated Visual Studio 2022 with .Net Framework 4.8 and .Net 6.0 or later versions installed.    
To work with it, the following steps should be executed:
1. Either clone the repository using a preferred GitHub client or download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/asposebarcode/Aspose_BarCode_NET/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to any folder on your computer. All examples are located in **Examples** folder
3. Check the file with the Visual Studio solution, *Aspose.BarCode.Examples.CSharp.sln*, in the folder
4. Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build a new project
5. Upon the first run, the dependencies will be downloaded automatically through NuGet
6. Check the **Data** folder in the root of **Examples** that contains the input files used in the provided code examples. You must download the **Data** folder together with the project
7. Open the *RunExamples.cs* file: all examples can be called from here
8. Uncomment the examples to be run within the project

In case of any issues with setting up or running code examples, reach out to [**Technical Support Forum**](https://forum.aspose.com/c/barcode).
