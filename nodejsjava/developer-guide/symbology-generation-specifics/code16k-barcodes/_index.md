## **Overview**
*Code16K* is a stacked multiple-row symbology that may include at most 16 rows. Each row in a barcode has the fixed length and can encode up to five symbols. It supports the data encoding structure that is alike the one of *Code128* symbology and encodes the same character set with similar data density. *Code16K* comprises checksum digits computed in two last characters for the whole barcode. However, no separate checksum controls are supported for a single row. A *Code16K* can encode at most 77 symbols or 154 numerical digits. Currently, this symbology is considered from the historical viewpoint and is rarely applied to real-life business tasks.

## **Barcode Height Settings**
In ***Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java***, it is possible to modify the row height of a *Code16K* barcode through the *setAspectRatio* method of class [*Code16KParameters*](). *AspectRatio* is determined as a relative coefficient to the value of *XDimension*. In the *Code16K* standard, the value of *AspectRatio* should be set larger than 8.  
  
Following *Code16K* barcodes have been created using various barcode height settings. 
  
|Aspect Ratio|Is Set to 10|Is Set to 20|

## **Quiet Zone Settings**
***Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java*** allows modifying the size of quiet zones in *Code16K* barcodes by calling *setQuietZoneLeftCoef* and *setQuietZoneRightCoef* methods of class [*Code16KParameters*](). Quiet zone coefficients are determined relatively to the value of *XDimension*.  
  
Following *Code16K* barcodes have been generated using various quiet zone settings.
