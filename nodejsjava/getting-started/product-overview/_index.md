# Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java

**Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java** is a powerful and reliable component for barcode generation and recognition,
developed using Node.js and Java.
It enables developers to quickly and easily integrate barcode functionality into Node.js applications.

## Product Description

**Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java** is a versatile library designed to streamline barcode processing tasks in
Node.js applications via Java. It offers robust capabilities for generating and recognizing both 1D (one-dimensional)
and 2D (two-dimensional) barcode types at any angle—quickly and efficiently.

This library supports over **80 barcode symbologies**, fully compatible with most industry standards and specifications.

A comprehensive list of supported barcode types is available in <a href="/barcode/nodejsjava/barcode-types/" target="_blank">Supported Barcode Types</a>.

The most important features are the following:
- **Barcode generation and recognition** for 80+ barcode types
- **Reading barcodes** at any angle and from images of various quality levels
- **Customizing barcode appearance**, including size, height, resolution, colors, rotation angle, text labels, captions,
  X-dimension, wide-to-narrow ratio, and more
- **Optimizing recognition engine settings** to balance accuracy and speed
- **Selecting a specific scanning region** for targeted barcode detection
- **Generating barcodes with special modes**, such as ECI, error correction, and embedded metadata
- **Rotating images** at any angle
- **Saving and loading barcodes** from files or data streams
- **Encoding and decoding non-ASCII characters** in 2D barcode formats
  See <a href="/barcode/nodejsjava/features/" target="_blank">The List of Product Features</a> for more details.
