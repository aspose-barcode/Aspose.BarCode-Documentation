## **General Features**
- Generate barcodes
- Scan, detect, and decode barcode images
- Read barcodes from image files or data streams
- Support over 60 barcode types, including 1D, 2D, and postal ones
- Customize barcode appearance-related properties
- Rotate barcodes at different angles
- Encode and decode non-English characters in 2D types
- Optimize recognition engine variables
- Load barcode data and save it to a stream or a file
- Print barcode images
- Work with complex barcode types (Swiss QR Code and Royal Mail Mailmark) 

## **Barcode Reading**
- Scan barcodes at any angle
- Save barcodes in popular image raster and vector formats, including JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, and GIF
- Set barcode image resolution from 75 to 600 dpi
- Support for the detection of damaged, blurred or noised images
- Set target barcode detection regions in a source image
- Set target barcode types for recognition
- Optimize recognition engine variables to achieve the desired trade-off between reading speed and quality
- Detect all barcodes displayed in the scanned region
- Validate checksum correctness for 1D and postal barcodes

## **Barcode Generation**
- Create barcodes with customized settings
- Modify barcode image appearance (size, resolution, height, background color, bar color, rotation angle, X-dimension, image quality, captions, wide-to-narrow-ratio, and other parameters)
- Save generated barcodes in various raster and vector image formats: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF, EMF, and SVG 
- Adjust encoding types and parameters
- Enable checksum controls (for 1D barcodes) and supplement data
- Modify the wide-to-narrow ratio for some barcode types to improve recognition accuracy
- Enable Error Checking and Correcting (ECC) or Extended Channel Interpretation (ECI) modes

## **Barcode Imaging**
- Customize barcode image borders, border color, style, margins, and width
- Customize barcode image color, caption color, text color, background color, and bar color
- Customize bar height
- Customize barcode caption appearance
- Rotate barcode images at any angle
- Customize quality and resolution settings for generated barcode images
- Enable anti-aliasing for barcode images
- Adjust size units 
- Enable auto-sizing of barcodes
