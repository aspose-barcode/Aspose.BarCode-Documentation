The download for both evaluation and full versions of Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint is the same. Simply download Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.barcode-for-sharepoint/default.aspx) and install it. Aspose.BarCode works in evaluation mode by default.
### **Evaluation Version Limitations**
The evaluation version has only one limitation: “Aspose” appears on every barcode until a valid license is applied.
