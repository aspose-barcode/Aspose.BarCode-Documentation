***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** is a robust and reliable barcode generation and recognition component written using PHP and JavaBridge. It allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to Java applications.

This article presents ***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** and its main features, including some important technical details. You can get information about its functionality, input and output image formats, important classes, and supported platforms.

## **Product Description**
***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** has many characteristics that make it a flexible and easy-to-use tool. It is a fully functional library that provides both generation and reading functionality. Generated barcodes can be saved in five high-quality raster image formats and two vector ones. The other advantage is that the library facilitates decoding even low-quality or damaged barcode images. Therefore, it enables high recognition efficiency for most of the supported barcode types. There are no printing limitations for barcodes generated through the Aspose.BarCode library. Developers can utilize any type of printers. The quality of printed barcode images will depend only on the resolution of a printer.

The barcode library provides fully featured demos and working examples written in Java to provide developers with a better understanding of our product. Using these demos, developers can quickly test functionality provided by Aspose.BarCode.

### **Main Features**
***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** benefits from a great variety of features that can serve to address various business needs. One of the most important functions is the customization of barcode appearance-related properties, including barcode size, color of barcode elements, rotation angle, image quality, X-dimension, resolution, text captions, and many others. Moreover, rich barcode reading and imaging functionality is available.  
  
The most important features are the following: 
- Barcode generation and recognition for over 60 barcode types
- Reading barcodes at any angle and from images of any quality
- Customization of barcode appearance (size, height, resolution, color, rotation angle, text label and captions, X-dimension, wide-to-narrow-ratio, and others)
- Optimization of recognition engine variables to achieve the desired trade-off between reading accuracy and speed
- Target scanning region selection
- Barcode generation using special modes, such as ECI, error correction, or embedded metadata
- Image rotation at any angle 
- Saving to or loading from stream or file 
- Encoding and decoding non-English characters in 2D types

The list of all features can be found in [**Product Features**](/barcode/phpjava/features/).

## **System Compatibility**
***Aspose.BarCode for PHP via Java*** is a platform-independent API that can be run on any platform (Windows, Linux, etc.) where PHP and Java Bridge are installed.
