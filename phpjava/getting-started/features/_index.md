## **Basic Features**
- Barcode image generation
- Barcode image scanning, detection, and decoding
- Support for more than 60 symbologies, including 1D, 2D, and postal barcode types
- Customization of barcode appearance-related properties
- Image rotation
- Encoding and decoding non-English characters in 2D types
- Optimization of recognition engine variables
- Data loading and saving to a stream or a file
- Label printing
- Support for complex barcodes (i.e. Swiss QR Code and Royal Mail Mailmark) 
- JSP, Servlet support

## **Barcode Recognition**
- Barcode scanning at any angle
- Support for common image raster and vector formats, including JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, and GIF
- Support for image resolution from 75 to 600 dpi
- Support for the detection of damaged, blurred or noised images
- Possibility to determine target barcode detection regions in a source image
- Possibility to define target barcode types for recognition
- Optimization of recognition engine variables to achieve the desired trade-off between reading speed and quality through manual settings or embedded presets
- Detection of all barcodes displayed in the scanned region
- Checksum validation for 1D and postal barcodes
- Increasing barcode detection speed through multithread barcode recognition

## **Barcode Generation**
- Barcode generation with customized settings
- Customization of barcode image appearance (size, resolution, height, background color, bar color, rotation angle, X-dimension, image quality, captions, wide-to-narrow-ratio, and others)
- Saving generated barcode images in various raster and vector image formats: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF, EMF, and SVG 
- Customization of encoding types and parameters
- Support for checksum controls (for 1D barcodes) and supplement data
- Customization of the wide-to-narrow ratio for some symbologies to improve recognition accuracy
- Support for Error Checking and Correcting (ECC) or Extended Channel Interpretation (ECI) modes

## **Barcode Imaging**
- Customization barcode image borders, border color, style, margins, and width
- Customization fo barcode image color, caption color, text color, background color, and bar color
- Customization of bar height
- Customization of barcode caption appearance
- Barcode rotation to any degree
- Customization of quality and resolution settings for generated barcode images
- Anti-aliasing for barcode images
- Size unit selection
- Auto-sizing of barcode labels
- Rendering images on any device
