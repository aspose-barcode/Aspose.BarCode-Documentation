**Welcome to Aspose.BarCode for .NET** 

Aspose.BarCode for .NET is a set of barcode generation and recognition components built to allow developers to add barcode functionality in their .NET applications. Aspose.BarCode provides GUI based controls for displaying barcodes in Windows Forms and exposes a simple set of classes that allow developers to create barcodes on the backend. Aspose.BarCode conforms to most of the barcode standards and specifications available nowadays. Aspose.BarCode for .NET doesn't just create barcodes but it provides a complete framework to control almost everything about them.

## **Product Description**
Aspose.BarCode for .NET is implemented using Managed C#. It allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to their Microsoft .NET applications (WinForms, WPF, and ASP.NET). Aspose.BarCode provides fully featured demos and working examples written in C# for developers to have a better understanding of our product. Using these demos, developers can quickly learn about the features provided by Aspose.BarCode. Using GUI controls in Aspose.BarCode, developers can drag and drop the controls on Windows Forms and set their properties in GUI mode like other controls in the .NET Framework. For the developers who are only interested in the backend processing of barcodes, Aspose.BarCode also provides a simple barcode class to ease their jobs.

Aspose.BarCode for .NET supports the most established barcode standards and barcode specifications. It has the ability to export to multiple image formats including BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, EMF, and SVG. Developers can use any kind of printer to print barcodes but naturally, the quality of the printed barcode images will be affected by the printer's resolution. Aspose.BarCode also supports the WPF framework, so that you can generate and recognize barcodes in your WPF applications.
### **General Barcode Features**
- Specify different kinds of symbologies.
- Barcode code text (data to be encoded to barcode image) can be set and its appearance-related properties like font, background color, foreground color, alignment and location (hide, above, below), etc. can also be modified.
- The barcode caption and its font, background color, foreground color, alignment and location (hide, above, below) can be managed.
- Checksum and supplement data are supported.
- Bar height of the barcode images can be customized.
- X-dimension and Y-dimension are also supported for 2D barcodes.
- Code128 encoding is exceptionally optimized.
- Wide to narrow ratio can be achieved for supported symbologies.
- WYSIWYG editing of barcodes is also supported using GUI-based controls.
- DataMatrix barcode with X12, EDIFACT and Base 256 encoding
### **Recognition Features**
- Barcode Recognition Aspose.BarCode.BarCodeReader reads most common 1D, 2D barcodes anywhere at any angle from an image
- Specify an area in the image to scan the barcode
- Get region information for the barcodes recognized in the image
### **Barcode Imaging Features**
- Manipulate the barcode image borders, border color, style, margins, width, etc.

## **Declaration**
All Aspose .NET components require the Full Trust permission set. The reason is, Aspose .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than a virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts, etc. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases. Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such security level applies the following constraints:

- OleDbPermission is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermission is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermission is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or range of addresses that you define in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermission is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

Due to the reasons specified above, Aspose .NET components cannot be used on servers granting permission set other than Full Trust.
