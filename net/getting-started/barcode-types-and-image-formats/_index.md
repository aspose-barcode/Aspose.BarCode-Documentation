## **Supported Barcode Types**
***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** supports over 60 different [barcode types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes) used in a variety of industries, including linear (1D), 2D (QR codes), and postal barcode types.

### **Linear (1D) barcodes**
***Linear barcode types*** is the first generation of one-dimensional barcodes that consists from bars and spaces of various widths that create specific patterns. Linear barcodes supported by ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** include the following barcode types.

| Barcode Type | Supported Symbologies |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Linear Numeric Only   | EAN13, EAN8, UPCA, UPCE, ISBN, ISMN, ISSN, Interleaved2of5, Standard2of5, MSI, Code11, Codabar, EAN14(SCC14), SSCC18, ITF14, IATA 2 of 5, DatabarOmniDirectional, DatabarStackedOmniDirectional, DatabarExpandedStacked, DatabarStacked, DatabarLimited, DatabarTruncated| 
| Linear Alpha-Numeric | GS1Code128, Code128, Code39 Extended, Code39 Standard, Code93 Extended, Code93 Standard, PatchCode, Matrix 2 of 5, DatabarExpanded |

### **2D barcodes**
A matrix codes, also known a ***2D barcodes***, is a two-dimensional way to represent information. They are more effective because can contain more data per unit area and most of them are self-correctable. 2D barcodes, supported by ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET***, include following barcode types:
- Aztec, 
- Compact PDF 417, 
- Data Matrix, 
- DotCode, 
- GS1 Data Matrix, 
- GS1 QR, 
- MaxiCode, 
- Macro PDF 417, 
- Micro PDF 417, 
- PDF 417, 
- QR, 
- MicroQR.

### **Postal barcodes**
***Postal barcode types*** are barcode types which are used by Postal Services in variety of countries. Postal barcodes supported by ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET***, include following barcode types:
- Australia Post, 
- AustralianPosteParcel, 
- Deutsche Post Identcode, 
- Deutsche Post Leticode, 
- Planet, 
- Postnet, 
- RM4SCC, 
- SingaporePost, 
- SwissPostParcel, 
- USPS OneCode.

## **Supported Image Formats**
Aspose.BarCode for .NET supports rendering barcode labels in 5 image file formats. These formats can be generated by ***BarcodeGenerator visual component*** and ***BarcodeGenerator class***. The following image formats are supported:
- [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/JPEG/) - The image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group.
- [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/TIFF/) - Tagged Image File Format.
- [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/PNG/) - Portable Network Graphics Image.
- [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/BMP/) - Bitmap Image Files.
- [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/GIF/) - Graphical Interchange Format Image.

BarcodeGenerator class can generate barcode labels in two additional vector formats but they are not supported for rendering by SQL Server Reporting Services engine:
- [EMF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/EMF/) - Enhanced Metafile Format.
- [SVG](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/SVG/) -Scalable Vector Graphics Files.
