## **.NET Standard 2.0**
The [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The motivation behind the .NET Standard is establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. The 'netstandard2.0' folder contain Aspose.BarCode assemblies to use with frameworks that implement .NET Standard 2.0 such as .NET Core 2.0.
