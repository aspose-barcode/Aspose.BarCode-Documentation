## **Create Two-Dimensional (2D) Barcodes**
Two-dimensional barcodes contain more data per label (up to thousands of characters) compared with linear (1D) barcode labels. Using [Aspose.BarCode for .NET](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/net/), it is possible to encode and store large amounts of text and data in a secure and efficient manner. Class [BarcodeGenerator](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.generation/barcodegenerator) is introduced in the library to handle barcode generation and supports creating both one- and two-dimensional barcodes. In such a way, it encapsulates both types of barcodes into the unified interface so that generating 2D barcodes is similar to that of 1D ones.

### **Create PDF417 barcode**
