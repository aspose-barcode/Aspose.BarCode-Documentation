## **Create Two Dimensional (2D) Barcodes**
The two-dimensional barcode can contain more data per label, up to thousands of characters. Large amounts of text and data can be stored securely and inexpensively when using [Aspose.BarCode](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/barcode) to encode.[BarCodeGenerator](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/barcode/aspose.barcode.generation/barcodegenerator) supports both one dimensional and two-dimensional barcodes. It encapsulates both types of barcode into one unified interface. Creating two-dimensional barcodes is just the same as creating one-dimensional barcodes.
