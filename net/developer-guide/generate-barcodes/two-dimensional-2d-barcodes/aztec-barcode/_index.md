## **Create the Aztec Barcode**
The Aztec barcode is a square grid high-density two-dimensional barcode symbology that can encode up to 3,000 alphanumeric characters.
### **How to produce an Aztec barcode**
Instantiate a [BarcodeGenerator](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/barcode/aspose.barcode.generation/barcodegenerator) and set its EncodeType to Aztec, and set its CodeText property for the data you want to encode. The following code snippet shows you how to generate an Aztec barcode.

### **Error correction**
The Aztec barcode allows code recovery when the barcode image is partly damaged, error correction level is ranging from 10% to 90%. Below is an example of setting up the Aztec barcode'sÂ [error correction level](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/barcode/aspose.barcode.windows.forms/barcodecontrol/properties/aztecterrorlevel). Aztec barcode sample with different error correction levels.
