## **Overview**
The *Postal* group of barcode standards has been developed to mitigate various limitations associated with 1D barcodes. In *Postal* barcodes, data encoding is based on varying the barcode height instead of the width of lines and spaces as in the case of 1D symbologies. In contrast, the information about horizontal parameters is ignored while reading *Postal* barcodes to avoid false-positive recognition.  
  
*Postal* barcodes have been specifically developed for the needs of postal services in different countries; therefore, they are functionally similar to each other and have only minor differences. There are two types of *Postal* symbologies: 2-state barcodes types that can take only numerical digits as input and 4-state ones that encode both numerical digits and uppercase English letters. Using the same barcode type, the former can encode one bit of data, while the latter can encode two bits.  
  
***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** enables generation and recognition of the following 2- and 4-state *Postal* symbologies: *Planet*, *Postnet*, *RM4SCC*, *Dutch KIX*, *OneCode*, *Australia Post*, and *Mailmark*. These barcode types are discussed further in the article.
