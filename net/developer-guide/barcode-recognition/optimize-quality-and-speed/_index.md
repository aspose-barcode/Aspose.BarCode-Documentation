This documentation part provides a detailed description of various recognition quality settings that can be customized to optimize the accuracy and speed of barcode reading in ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET***.

Barcode recognition is based on machine vision techniques and utilizes sophisticated mathematical algorithms for object detection and reading. Similar to other computer vision applications, converting an arbitrary image into a machine-readable code strongly depends on the quality of the source image. Namely, barcode images with low quality may be deemed unreadable according to accepted standards. Various methods can be used to recognize barcodes even with unacceptable quality; however, using these methods requires additional CPU computation time and leads to considerably increasing overall reading time.  
  
***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** allows optimizing the barcode recognition process in terms of speed and quality depending on particular business needs and specificities. The library provides a special class called [*QualitySettings*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/qualitysettings) that can be used to implement flexible settings for barcode recognition and to reach the required trade-off between reading capacity and speed according to the quality of source barcode images.
