## **Software Requirements**
The following requirements need to be fulfilled before downloading and running the code samples of ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** applications.

1. Visual Studio vesrion 2010 or later
2. The latest API version of NuGet Package Manager installed in Visual Studio. Details on how to install NuGet package manager can be found [here](<http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/guides/install-nuget>). Then, it is necessary to verify the NuGet Package Manager activation. To do this, go to **Tools**->Options->NuGet Package Manager->Package Sources: the option **nuget.org** must be checked 
4. The project with available examples relies on the *NuGet Automatic Package Restore* feature. Therefore, active Internet connection is necessary. If it is unavailable on the machine, where examples are to be executed, please see in [Installation](https://docs.aspose.com/barcode/net/installation/) how to add a reference to *Aspose.BarCode.dll* to the example project manually.

## **Download from GitHub**
All code examples available for ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET). The project with examples has been created in Visual Studio 2013; however, the solution file is compatible with Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and later.  
To work with it, the following step should be executed:
- Either clone the repository using a preferred GitHub client or download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET/archive/master.zip)
- Extract the contents of the ZIP file to any folder on the computer. All examples are located in **Examples** folder
- Check the file with the Visual Studio solution, *Aspose.BarCode.Examples.CSharp.sln*, in the folder
- Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build a new project
- Upon the first run, the dependencies will be downloaded automatically through NuGet
- Check **Data** folder at the root of **Examples** that contains input files used in code examples. You must download the **Data** folder together with the example project <!--this is unclear-->
- Open *RunExamples.cs* file: all examples can be called from here
- Uncomment the examples to be run within the project

In case of any issues with setting up or running code examples, reach out to **Technical Support [Forums**](https://forum.aspose.com/c/barcode).
