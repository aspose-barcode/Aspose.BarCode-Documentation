## **Software Requirements**
The following requirements need to be fulfilled before downloading and running the code samples of ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** applications.

1. Visual Studio version 2019 or later
2. The project with examples uses the *NuGet Automatic Package Restore* feature. Therefore, active Internet connection is necessary to install this package. If you have any problems with automatic restoring or downloading the project through NuGet, you can check this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore-troubleshooting) or ask for help on [**Aspose Technical Forum**](https://forum.aspose.com/c/barcode/13)

## **Download Examples from GitHub**
All code examples available for ***Aspose.BarCode for .NET*** are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET/tree/master/Examples). The project requires at least fully updated Visual Studio 2019 with .Net Framework 4.8 and .Net 5 or later versions installed.    
To work with it, the following steps should be executed:
1. Either clone the repository using a preferred GitHub client or download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/asposebarcode/Aspose_BarCode_NET/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to any folder on your computer. All examples are located in **Examples** folder
3. Check the file with the Visual Studio solution, *Aspose.BarCode.Examples.CSharp.sln*, in the folder
4. Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build a new project
5. Upon the first run, the dependencies will be downloaded automatically through NuGet
6. Check the **Data** folder in the root of **Examples** that contains the input files used in the provided code examples. You must download the **Data** folder together with the project
7. Open the *RunExamples.cs* file: all examples can be called from here
8. Uncomment the examples to be run within the project

In case of any issues with setting up or running code examples, reach out to [**Technical Support Forum**](https://forum.aspose.com/c/barcode).
