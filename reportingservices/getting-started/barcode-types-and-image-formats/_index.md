## **Supported Barcode Types**
***Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services*** supports over 80 different [barcode types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes) used in a variety of industries. These include linear (1D), Postal and 2D barcode symbols.

**Linear barcode types**, or *1D barcodes*, correspond to the first generation of one-dimensional barcodes (1D) that are used to represent information by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. Some 1D symbologies allow encoding only numbers, while others permit encoding also letters.  

**DataBar barcodes** (former RSS-14) are 1D and 1D staked barcodes, which were developed to efficiently encode [*GS1 Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en) data.

**Matrix barcodes**, also known as *2D barcodes*, have been introduced as a two-dimensional way to encode information. Two-dimensional (2D) barcodes are generated using various symbols and shapes. This barcode type is considered to be more efficient, as such barcodes contain more data per unit area, and most of them are self-correctable.  
  
**Postal barcodes** are specific symbologies used by postal services in different countries.

**HIBC barcodes** encode data in [special format](https://www.hibcc.org/udi-labeling-standards/barcode-standards/) which is used in Health Industry. As transport, the barcodes use other 1D and 2D barcodes and encode data as Alpha-Numeric.

**GS1 barcodes** use other 1D and 2D barcodes to encode [*GS1 Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en) data.

## **Supported Image Formats**
Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services supports rendering barcode labels in 5 image file formats. These formats can be generated by ***BarcodeGenerator visual component*** and ***BarcodeGenerator class***. The following image formats are supported:
- [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/JPEG/) - The image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group.
- [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/TIFF/) - Tagged Image File Format.
- [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/PNG/) - Portable Network Graphics Image.
- [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/BMP/) - Bitmap Image Files.
- [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/GIF/) - Graphical Interchange Format Image.

BarcodeGenerator class can generate barcode labels in two additional vector formats but they are not supported for rendering by SQL Server Reporting Services engine:
- [EMF](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/EMF/) - Enhanced Metafile Format.
- [SVG](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/SVG/) -Scalable Vector Graphics Files.
