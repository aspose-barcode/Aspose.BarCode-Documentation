## **Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java**
### **General Barcode Features**
- Specify different kinds of symbologies.
- Barcode Code text (data to be encoded to barcode image) can be set and its appearance-related properties like font, back color, fore color, alignment and location (hide, above, below) etc. can also be modified.
- Barcode Caption and its font, back color, fore color, alignment and location (hide, above, below) can be managed.
- Checksum and Supplement Data are supported.
- The bar height of the barcode images can be customized.
- X-dimension, Y-dimension (for 2D BarCodes) are also supported.
- Code128 encoding is exceptionally optimized.
- Wide to Narrow Ratio can be achieved for supported symbologies.
### **Barcode Recognition Features**

### **Supported Barcode Symbologies**
***Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java*** supports over 80
different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes" target="_blank">barcode types</a> used in a
variety of industries, namely, 1D (linear), 2D (including QR codes), and postal symbologies. The detailed information
about generating barcodes using various barcode standards can be found in
section <a href="/barcode/java/generate-barcode-types/" target="_blank">Generation Specifics for Symbologies</a>.

**Linear barcode types**, or *1D barcodes*, correspond to the first generation of one-dimensional barcodes (1D) that are
used to represent information by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. Some 1D symbologies allow encoding
only numbers, while others permit encoding also letters.

**DataBar barcodes** (former RSS-14) are 1D and 1D staked barcodes, which were developed to efficiently encode [*GS1
Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en) data.

**Matrix barcodes**, also known as *2D barcodes*, have been introduced as a two-dimensional way to encode information.
Two-dimensional (2D) barcodes are generated using various symbols and shapes. This barcode type is considered to be more
efficient, as such barcodes contain more data per unit area, and most of them are self-correctable.

**Postal barcodes** are specific symbologies used by postal services in different countries.

**HIBC barcodes** encode data in [special format](https://www.hibcc.org/udi-labeling-standards/barcode-standards/) which
is used in Health Industry. As transport, the barcodes use other 1D and 2D barcodes and encode data as Alpha-Numeric.

**GS1 barcodes** use other 1D and 2D barcodes to encode [*GS1 Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en)
data.
