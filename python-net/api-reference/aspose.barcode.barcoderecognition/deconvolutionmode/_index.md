## DeconvolutionMode enumeration

Deconvolution (image restorations) mode which defines level of image degradation. Originally deconvolution is a function which can restore image degraded <br/>            (convoluted) by any natural function like blur, during obtaining image by camera. Because we cannot detect image function which corrupt the image, <br/>            we have to check most well know functions like sharp or mathematical morphology.
