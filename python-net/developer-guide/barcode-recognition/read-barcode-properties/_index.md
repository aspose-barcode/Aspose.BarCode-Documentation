***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET*** not only enables reading information encoded in a barcode but also provides a possibility to analyze its technical properties, including barcode type, orientation angle, position, and metadata. This data is stored in objects of class [*BarCodeResult*](/barcode/python-net/api-reference/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcoderesult/) and can be fetched using properties described further in this section.
