## **Barcode Types**
***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET*** supports more than 60 [barcode types](/barcode/info-cards/) used in various industries, i.e., linear (1D), matrix (2D), and postal barcodes. 
    
**Linear barcode types**, or *1D barcodes*, relate to the first generation of one-dimensional (1D) barcode types that decode data by changing the widths of black and white parallel lines. Particular 1D standards support encoding only numbers, while others allow encoding also letters and special symbols.  

**Matrix barcode types**, also referred as *2D barcode types*, have been developed as an advanced way to encode data. Two-dimensional (2D) types imply creating barcodes composed of various figures and shapes. These barcode standards are deemed to have better efficiency compared with 1D barcodes owing to their improved data density and data recovery mechanisms.  
  
**Postal types** are special barcode standards introduced by postal services in various countries.

## **Image Formats**
***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET*** allows rendering barcode images in the five most widespread image formats. Two additional vector formats can be used for barcode generation, but they are not supported for rendering by the SQL Server Reporting Services engine. The image formats available for input and output are listed below.
