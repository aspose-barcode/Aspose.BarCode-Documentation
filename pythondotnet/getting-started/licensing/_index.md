## **Overview**
The evaluation mode of ***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET*** allows generating barcode images without restrictions. However, a watermark will be displayed on the resulting barcode image (words “Aspose”). The unlicensed version can be used to read barcodes of all supported types. Please note that only *Code 39* can be decoded without limitations; as a result of reading barcodes corresponding to other types, 30% of decoded text will be masked with " * ". All other actions with barcodes using ***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET*** need setting a license. After purchasing a license, you will get access to the whole functionality of the library and the ability to perform barcode generation and reading without limitations and watermark placement.
