## **Overview**
The Royal Mail *Mailmark* symbology has been developed to encode postal and shipping information in the format defined in the *DataMatrix* standard. The *Mailmark 2D* symbology includes three types denoted as 7, 9, and 29; they differ from each other in terms of customer data capacity. Customer information is encoded in addition to the main barcode data in special predefined barcode fields. The amount of space to store customer data depends on the barcode type and the used encoding. This information can serve to describe print and scanning operations, identify items, or enable barcode scanning with smartphones.  

To perform data encoding, the *Mailmark 2D* standard uses the basic C40 character set (numerical digits, uppercase English letters, and the space character). All fields of information to be encoded in a *Mailmark 2D* barcode except customer data must be entered in the format compatible with the mentioned encoding standard. The customer information field does not require to comply with this encoding; however, using alternative encodings may affect the overall barcode data capacity.  
  
To work with *Mailmark 2D* barcodes in ***Aspose.BarCode for Python via .NET***, it is necessary to use class [*Mailmark2DCodetext*]().
