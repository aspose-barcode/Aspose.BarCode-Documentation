In some cases, developers may need to get information about the placement region of a source barcode and its orientation angle. To enable such a possibility, ***Aspose.BarCode for C++*** provides a group of properties called [*RegionParameters*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcoderegionparameters) that stores the following information:
-	Quadrangle – a quadrangle object that bounds a barcode
-	Rectangle - a rectangle object that bounds a barcode
-	Points – an array of points constituting a barcode
-	Angle – an orientation angle in degrees
