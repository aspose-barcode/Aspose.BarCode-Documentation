As a result of barcode reading, ***Aspose.BarCode for C++*** allows not only decoding the main data stored in a barcode, but also getting information about its technical parameters, such as type, placement region, orientation angle, and metadata. The library saves this information in a specific object type called [*BarCodeResult*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcoderesult) so that each instance of this class corresponds to one processed barcode. Further in this article, it is explained how to get the required information about barcode properties using the functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for C++***.
