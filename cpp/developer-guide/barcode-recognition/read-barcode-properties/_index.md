As a result of barcode reading, ***Aspose.BarCode for C++*** allows not only decoding the main data stored in a barcode, but also getting information about its technical parameters, such as type, placement region, orientation angle, and metadata. The library saves this information in a specific object type called [*BarCodeResult*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcoderesult) so that each instance of this class corresponds to one processed barcode. The articles listed below explain how to get the required information about barcode properties using the functionality of ***Aspose.BarCode for C++***.
