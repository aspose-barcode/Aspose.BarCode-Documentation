In ***Aspose.BarCode for C++***, there is a special parameter called [*DetectEncoding*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcodesettings/properties/detectencoding) that allows enabling the automatic recognition of UTF8 and UTF16 Unicode encodings for 2D barcode recognition, as well as re-encoding the data into a Unicode string. When this mode is disabled, the barcode data can be read and decoded manually using the required encoding.
