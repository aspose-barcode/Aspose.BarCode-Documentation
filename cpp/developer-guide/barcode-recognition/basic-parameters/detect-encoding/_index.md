In ***Aspose.BarCode for C++***, there is a special parameter called *DetectEncoding* that allows enabling the automatic recognition of UTF8 and UTF16 Unicode encodings for 2D barcode recognition, as well as re-encoding the data into a Unicode string. When this mode is disabled, the barcode data can be read and decoded manually using the required encoding.
