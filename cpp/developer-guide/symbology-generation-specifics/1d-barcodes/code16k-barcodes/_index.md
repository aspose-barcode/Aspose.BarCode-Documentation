{{% alert color="primary" %}}[Generate Code 16K Barcodes Online](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/generate/code16k): You can test the quality of ***Aspose.BarCode*** generation for Code 16K barcodes and get the results online.{{% /alert %}}

## **Overview**
*Code 16K* is a multiple-row barcode symbology that may contain up to 16 rows; each row has a fixed length and can include up to five characters. It has the data encoding structure similar to that of the *Code128* barcode type and allows encoding the same set of characters with equal data density. *Code 16K* contains a checksum for an entire barcode that is calculated in two last characters; however, it does not provide a separate checksum for each row. A barcode of this symbology can encode up to 77 data characters or 154 numerical digits. At present, this barcode type is interesting mainly from the historical point of view and is rarely used in healthcare applications.

## **Barcode Height Settings**
***Aspose.BarCode for C++*** allows adjusting the height of each row in a *Code 16K* barcode by initializing the *AspectRatio* property of class *Code16KParameters*. *AspectRatio* is defined as a relative coefficient to the value of the *XDimension* property. In the *Code 16K* symbology, it is recommended to set the value of *AspectRatio* greater than 8.  
  
Sample *Code 16K* barcode labels demonstrated below have been generated with different barcode height settings.

## **Quiet Zone Settings**
For the *Code 16K* symbology, ***Aspose.BarCode for C++*** enables adjusting the size of quiet zones on the left and right sides of a barcode by setting the *QuietZoneLeftCoef* and *QuietZoneRightCoef* properties respectively. These properties correspond to class *Code16KParameters* and are defined as relative coefficients to the value of the *XDimension* parameter.  
  
*Code 16K* barcode images demonstrated below have been created using different settings of quiet zones.
