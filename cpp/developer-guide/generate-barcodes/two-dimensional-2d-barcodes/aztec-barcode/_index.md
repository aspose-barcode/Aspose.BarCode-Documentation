## **Create the Aztec Barcode**
The Aztec barcode is a square grid high-density two-dimensional barcode symbology which can encode up to 3,000 alphanumeric characters.
### **How to produce an Aztec barcode**
Instantiate a BarcodeGenerator and set its EncodeType to Aztec, and set its CodeText property for the data you want to encode. The following code snippet shows you how to generate an Aztec barcode.

### **Error correction**
Aztec barcode allows code recovery when the barcode image is partly damaged, error correction level is ranging from 10% to 90%. Below is an example of setting up Aztec barcode's error correction level. Aztec barcode sample with different error correction levels.
